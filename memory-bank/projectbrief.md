**Document Version:** 1.0 (Derived from Spec v3.0)
**Date:** 2024-07-16

## 1. Product
FlatPay

## 2. Vision
To be the preferred, user-friendly, secure, and affordable financial and operational management platform for small-to-medium residential communities (approx. 10-150 units) in India, focused on automating tedious tasks and providing clear financial visibility.

## 3. Core Problem
Manual spreadsheet-based society management is inefficient, error-prone, lacks transparency, hinders timely collections, and consumes excessive volunteer time. Existing complex HOA software is often unsuitable or too costly for smaller communities.

## 4. Solution
FlatPay provides a secure, Supabase-powered **Responsive Web Application** with an intuitive interface for society managers. It automates billing cycles, incorporates various charge types (recurring, allocated expenses, metered usage), streamlines communication (WhatsApp), facilitates payment collection (manual & automated UPI), and offers clear reporting.
